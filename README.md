# Student Grades Spreadsheet Project

This project contains a spreadsheet that includes data for 30 students and their performance across multiple subjects. The data reflects a variety of results, from high achievers to students who may need more support.

## 📋 Overview
The spreadsheet tracks the following subjects for each student:
- **Bangla**
- **English**
- **Physics**
- **Chemistry**
- **Mathematics**
- **Biology**
- **ICT**

The grades for each subject range between 10 and 100, ensuring a diverse dataset for analysis. This can be useful for statistical studies, grade ranking, and performance evaluation.

## 📈 Features
- **Rank Calculation**: The spreadsheet uses ranking formulas to determine each student's position based on their total marks.
- **Grade Distribution**: Different grade categories are calculated to determine whether students pass or fail.
- **Visual Representation**: You can easily add charts or graphs to visualize the performance of students over different subjects.

## 📝 How to Use
- **Download the Spreadsheet**: You can download the `.xlsx` or `.ods` file from this repository.
- **Open in Excel/LibreOffice Calc**: The file is compatible with both Excel and LibreOffice Calc.
- **Modify or Analyze**: Feel free to modify the data or use it for your own analysis and projects.

## 🚀 Future Updates
In the future, I plan to:
- Add more advanced analysis and visualizations.
- Expand the project to include automated data analysis using Python or other tools.
  
Stay tuned for updates!

## 💡 Usage
